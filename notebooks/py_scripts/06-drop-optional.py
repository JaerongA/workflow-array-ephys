# # Drop schemas
#
# + Schemas are not typically dropped in a production workflow with real data in it. 
# + At the developmental phase, it might be required for the table redesign.
# + When dropping all schemas is needed, the following is the dependency order.

# Change into the parent directory to find the `dj_local_conf.json` file.

import os
os.chdir('..')

# +
from workflow_array_ephys.pipeline import *

# ephys.schema.drop()
# probe.schema.drop()
# session.schema.drop()
# subject.schema.drop()
# lab.schema.drop()
